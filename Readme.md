# Blazor DataGrid - Bind a grid to a DataTable object

â›” DEPRECATED. The Data Grid was moved to maintenance support mode. No new features/capabilities will be added to this component. We recommend that you [migrate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403162/grid/migrate-from-data-grid-to-grid) to the [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) component that support binding to a DataTable object out of the box.
